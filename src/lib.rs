//! Mockable abstraction layer over OS operations for testable Rust code.
//!
//! This crate provides a unified [`System`] trait for all external system interactions,
//! allowing for easy testing with mock implementations.
//!
//! # Implementations
//!
//! - [`RealSystem`](real::RealSystem): Production implementation using `std::env` and `std::fs`.
//! - [`MemorySystem`](mock::MemorySystem): In-memory implementation for fast, isolated unit tests.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use os_shim::{System, mock::MemorySystem};
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! let system = MemorySystem::new()
//!     .with_env("HOME", "/home/user").unwrap()
//!     .with_file("/test/file.txt", b"Hello, world!").unwrap()
//!     .with_dir("/test/subdir").unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!(system.env_var("HOME").unwrap(), "/home/user");
//! assert!(system.exists(Path::new("/test/file.txt")).unwrap());
//! ```
